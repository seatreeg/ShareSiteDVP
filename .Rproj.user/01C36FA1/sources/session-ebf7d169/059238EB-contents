$$
Standard Error =\sqrt{\frac{variance}{n}}
$$

STANDARD ERROR: The approximate standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

If we replace the population variacne in the Z statistic formula with the standard error, we can calculate the T statistic:

$$
Z= \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$

$$
T= \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sqrt{\frac{s}{n}}}
$$

Now the system for the critical value, standardized statistic, and p value is the same as before: we use a table, but there is an extra aspect to look out for: the degrees of freedom.

The degrees of freedom in this context is just the sample size minus 1.

$$
df = n-1
$$

DEGREES OF FREEDOM: the maximum number of logically independent values, which are values that have the freedom ton vary. You can also think of this as a measure of how close the statistic is approaching the Z.

With this information, you can calculate T statistics with a method almost identical to the way Z statistics were calculated. But what is the relevance of the T statistic?

If the sample variance is unknown (as it most often tends to be), and we are calculating this score using a sample mean, then the Z statistic will not work.
