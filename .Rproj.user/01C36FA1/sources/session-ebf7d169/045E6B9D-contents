title: "PreSemesterToDo"
---

Prior to the semester, I will expect myself to complete the following tasks:

-   REFINE upcoming materials + handouts

    -   While I feel like I have put effort into these. I will likely find many flaws and possible improvements prior to class. As such, I will likely need to make some changes, so i will go through the first 2+ weeks to prepare.

-   Initialize canvas and upload introduction activity early

    -   This intro activity will tell me how students perceive the class and how to address them. This will be a short and easy assignment, but will help me prepare some class expectations and be help with communication later on.

-   Grab the physical materials needed for demonstrations and activities and place them in a file at least one week ahead.

-   Find out if my class is MWF or TR, and make minor adjustments to the time plan.

-   Prepare a few outfits for class

-   Write up exact homework questions for the first assessments on canvas, and record some expectations for in class activities.
