GENERALIZABILITY: how well the information in the sample works for the larger population rather than just being representative of the sample

REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE: a sample which is representative of the whole population for which it has been drawn.

GENERALIZATIONS: making conclusions from the sample, which can be used to make conclusions outside of the sample to the larger population

BIAS: when a statistic consistently overestimates or underestimates.

CONVINIENT SAMPLING: when samples are selected based on convenience and availability rather than more evenly dispersed randomness.

example: asking everyone outside of your workplace to take a poll rather than driving around your city to sample from all areas.

SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING: Every individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected an involved in the sample.

NOTE: it may seem like simple random sampling is "good" sampling and convenient sampling is "bad" sampling, but sometimes convenient sampling is selected for ethical reasons (e.g. only selecting **willing**Â participants) as using a true random sample would be unethical.

OTHER FORMS OF SAMPLING: These will not be mentioned in this session, but just know that they exist.

SAMPLING FRAME: list of all individuals in a population.
