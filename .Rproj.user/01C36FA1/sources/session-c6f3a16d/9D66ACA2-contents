## DAY 3

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Vocab Time - population and sample: 25 minutes

**Objectives:**

> Students can properly differentiate between a sample and population
>
> Students can identify the observational units and variables in a study
>
> Students understand the difference between an experiment and an observational study
>
> Students know why we use samples

**Concepts:**

> Population
>
> Sample
>
> proportion
>
> mean
>
> INTRODUCE THE BLOCK
>
> Observational Unit
>
> Observational Study
>
> Experiment

**Intuition Tools:**

> Burger stats

**Lesson Material:**

Quite a minimal lesson, students will have a vocab handout and follow along with a slideshow with definitions and examples

POPULATION: The group of everything you want to know about

example: "all humans", "all UNL students", "all Toyata Previas"

SAMPLE: The subset you grabbed from the population to get an idea of the population

examples: "1000 humans", "25 UNL students", "5 Toyota Previas"\

Why we use samples:

-   less effort/cost

-   measurement destruction

-   impossibility

As an example of desruction, students will be told the about the burger example and the dissection example, where observing destroys the entity in question.

In the case of impossibility, animal studies will be mentioned.

NOTE: you can measure entire populations if you simply define your population to be manageable: (e.g. a whole class)

VARIABLE: Any measurable characteristic

examples: "height", "vertical jump" , "mass", "color", "shape", "whether or not a person said they liked Toyota Previas"

EXPLANATORY VARIABLE: expected cause of an event. Similar to the "independent variable"

RESPONSE VARIABLE: the observed outcome for a explanatory variable. Similar to the "dependent variable"\\

example:

explanatory="amount of milk given to participants in an experiment"

response="digestive issues reported following the treatment"

LURKING VARIABLE: variable that impacts the explanatory and response variable, causing a false association

Observational Unit: The unit at which the data is collected. NOT THE UNIT USED TO MEASURE THE VARIABLE

examples: "a single person asked their opinion on Toyota Previas", "A single piece of ice measured in mass", "a single bird that had its speed measured"

OBSERVATIONAL STUDY: Study where the variables are not manipulated, and are instead passively observed.

example:"asking several people if they smoke and then seeing how fast they can pedal a bicycle"

EXPERIMENT: Study where the independent variable is manipulated by scientists and the response variable is measured

example:"making several people smoke for a few months and then seeing how fast they can pedal a bicycle"

(note, assessment is in the activity)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Activity- population and sample: 25 minutes**

VOCAB: students will be arranged into groups an placed in a region of the class with writing materials (if it is not a class with 360 boards on the walls, I will go out and prepare some big writing devices to slap on the wall) Students will then be given an example of study, and then be asked:

-   is this an observational study or an experiment

-   what is the population

-   what is the sample

-   what are the variables being measured?

-   which variables are response and which are explanatory

-   what is the observational unit in the study

Groups will then be given a moment to discuss, and if the groups do not concur, an open discussion will take place.
