HOMEWORK:

To avoid homework from causing any stressful cramming and loss sleep, homeworks will be cut into small pieces that are assigned and completed for each section completed. This means that you may have 1 or more homeworks assigned per week, but they will be very short, and wil not be due until the necessary information is taught in class.

PARTICIPATION:

These are usually given as 100% or 0%. If you are present in class and attempt to participate in the activities, you will get these points.

SICK/ABSENT POLICY:

Absences will result in a zero in the daily participation points, however, these points can be earned back.

The current policy for earning points back is attending office hours/zoom and explaining the information that you were absent for, and answering a few questions. Once this is considered satisfactory, you will earn a credit for a missed class. You may only do this at a rate of one point back per week.

If a particularly bad illness happens or another difficult circumstances, a doctors note or other relevant form of documentation may be provided and all points will be given back without needing to accomplish a task.

CALCULATORS

Calculators will be allowed on tests. Graphers are allowed if you register to have your memory cleared 10 minutes before the exam. Once cleared, you will be provided with a sticker showing proof of clearing.

EXAM STRUCTURE

\@\@ideally i would like to provide tests in way that is proctored yet allows for significant time, but I am currently working out how that would be achieved. I ideal circumstances, I could be a late class that allows students ample time after the scheduled time, but things dont always work out as planned, so I will gather more information before setting this in stone

FINAL PROJECT

Rather than a final exam, you will be expected to do a group/solo project where you will be given a practical question to answer using the information that was covered in class. The project will be in three parts: a presentation,paper, and reflection. The presentation will be given during classtimes, and the paper will be submitted a few days after presentations. Attendance and reflections on your own and other classmates projects will be required to receive a full grade.

ACADEMIC HONESTY

As with all courses, academic dishonesty can potentially result in significant grade reduction and further punishment. If you are suspected of committing academic dishonesty, you will be given a chance to meet and discuss what had happen before facing any punishment.

Students may be randomly asked to casually discuss the answers they have provided on assignments. Being called in does NOT mean that you are being accused of academic dishonesty, and you will be given ample time to collect your thoughts as explaining answers is inherently stressful for many students.

The polices for academic dishonesty will be stated on a per assignment basis, so while it may be allowed to discuss problems with others on one assignment, it may not be allowed for another. In general, copying statements word for word in your answers will NOT be allowed.

PHOTO POLICY

Students often take photos of the board to save time on notes. These notes will be provided on the canvas website, and any relevant board information will be shared as well. So photos should not be required.

Please do not take pictures in class without permission prior, as many students prefer not to be recorded. If you would like a copy of any information in class, please let me know!
