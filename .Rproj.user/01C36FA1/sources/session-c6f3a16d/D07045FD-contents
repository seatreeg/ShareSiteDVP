## DAY 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Syllabus Day: 25 minutes**

**Objectives:**

> Students understand course expectations
>
> Students understand the policies in place for the class
>
> Students are aware of what resources and accommodations are available to them
>
> Core rules are stressed enough to be easily remembered

**Concepts:**

> The syllabus

Just for safety, I will check here to make sure everyone understands mean, median, and mode. You never know where someone is coming from, and I wouldn't mind going over it.

Activity: Students will be assigned a starter activity (at home)so I know some basic info about their perception of the class, concerns, and how to address them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**\-\-\--\>First Lecture: 25 minutes**

**Course objectives**

> Students know the main datatypes and when to use them
>
> Students can draw a connection chart (flowchart labeled how they are related to each other) between classes, histograms, relative frequency histograms, and probability distributions
>
> Students can label the shape of distributions fitting the main distribution shapes

**Concepts:**

> variable
>
> categorical vs quantitative
>
> classes
>
> histograms/relative frequency histograms
>
> probability distributions
>
> shape

**Intuition Tools:**

> Probability distributions as machines that pump out random numbers
>
> Probability as area, in literal square meters
>
> Probability distributions as historgrams
>
> Discrete as dice
>
> Continuous as spinner
>
> Ray gun skew

**Lesson material:**

VARIABLE: this is any measurable quality of an entity

Variables have two subgroups:

CATEGORICAL: relating to groups which can be represented by numbers, but do not operate like numbers. Their spacing is either inconsistent or illogical.

Categorical variables have two groups:

nominal: groups which have no implied order ("carbs", "protein", "fats")

ordinal: groups which have an implied order, but not necessarily a number (letter grades, outcome of a race)

QUANTITATIVE: measurements that have numerical values that operate like regular integers/real numbers do. Their spacing is even and predictable.

Quantitative variable shave two groups:

discrete: If there are finite points between two points in the set, the variable is discrete (people in a room, dice roll points, number of trials succeeded)

##I need to find out if rationals are discrete or continuous; update, apparently its continuous

##personal note: some classes discuss the ratio and interval data types, but I had found this setup with continuous and discrete more relevant to this kind of statistics work.

continuous: if there is an infinite number of points between two points, the variable is continuous (time, distance(kinda), mass(big kinda))

CLASSES: groups of values chunked together, usually to groupn a bunch of values that would be disorderly otherwise

HISTOGRAM: chart that essentially tallies the number of items that fit in each class in a set, except instead of using tallies, you fill in bars.

RELATIVE FREQUENCY HISTOGRAM: chart thats exactly like a histogram, but instead of being charted by the number of values in a class, its the number of values in a class divided by the total, forming a fraction between 0 and 1 (equivalently forming a percent between 0% and 100%)

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION: Much like the relative frequency histogram, but instead of thinking of the chart as the outcome of a measurement, it is treated as a machine that pumps out results. The probability of each result is the percentage seen on the side. NOTE: the idea of RVs as the outputs of a machine will be one of the intuition tools used in this class

Important note: the probabilities can be added up, as the bars take up a certain amount of area, and area = probability (or at least, this is a way of thinking about it visually, which i intend to use to make statistics more intuitive and visual)

DISCRETE DISTRIBUTION: Probability distribution, but with discrete values ONLY. Think dice.

CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTION: Probability distribution, with an infinite number of values between two points. Think wheel spinner, but with no pegs - just a rainbow of possible hues.

SHAPE: the literal shape of a distribution, but rather than using traditional shapes, we use words like symmetric, non symmetric ,skewed, unimodal, bimodal, and uniform. (this is where a picture will be provided with these shapes)

skewed right: mean\>median\>mode(peak)

skewed left: mean\<median\<mode(peak)

Symmetric unimodal: mean=median=mode

Here I plan to use the ray gun example on how to remember which skew it is. (the ray gun example is a strategy I came up with to remember skew, if the ray gun is pointing right, its skewed right, if the ray gun is pointing left, its skewed left)

**Assessment:**

DATATYPES: To assess the students knowledge of datatypes, they will be given a list of variables and told to arrange them into certain boxes by their datatype. For example, if the variable "time required to finish a test" is given, it will be put in the variable\>quantitative\> continuous

DISTRIBUTIONS AND CHARTS: Students will be given a list of numbers, and a desired class size, and from that they will be asked to count the classes, make a histogram, then a relative frequency histogram, then a discrete probability distribution by hand. Finally, they will be asked to use the chart determine the probability of getting a number in one of two of the classes, which can be added. #verify accuracy of this last part\\

SHAPE: Students will be given two exercises to asses the knowledge of shape. The first will be to observe a few distributions and declare their shape, and the next part they will be given a mean, median, and mode (then later just two) and asked to determine the skew of a distribution.
