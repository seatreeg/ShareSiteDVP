DATA: The measured values or categories recorded on an individual of interest.

POPULATION: The complete collection of ALL items of interest for a given problem

example: "all humans", "all UNL students", "all Toyata Previas"

SAMPLE: Sub collection of items from the population

examples: "1000 humans", "25 UNL students", "5 Toyota Previas"

VARIABLE: Any measurable characteristic

examples: "height", "vertical jump" , "mass", "color", "shape", "whether or not a person said they liked Toyota Previas"

EXPLANATORY VARIABLE: expected cause of an event. Similar to the "independent variable"

RESPONSE VARIABLE: the observed outcome for a explanatory variable. Similar to the "dependent variable"

example:

explanatory="amount of milk given to participants in an experiment"

response="digestive issues reported following the treatment"

LURKING VARIABLE: variable that impacts the explanatory and response variable, causing a false association

Observational Unit: The unit at which the data is collected. NOT THE UNIT USED TO MEASURE THE VARIABLE

examples: "a single person asked their opinion on Toyota Previas", "A single piece of ice measured in mass", "a single bird that had its speed measured"

OBSERVATIONAL STUDY: Study where the variables are not manipulated, and are instead passively observed.

example:"asking several people if they smoke and then seeing how fast they can pedal a bicycle"

EXPERIMENT: Study where the independent variable is manipulated by scientists and the response variable is measured

example:"making several people smoke for a few months and then seeing how fast they can pedal a bicycle"
