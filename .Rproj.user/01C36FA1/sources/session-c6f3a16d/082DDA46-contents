## DAY 2

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Carson Custom Day: 50minutes**

This lesson is one that i have not seen on many lesson plans, but I believe will be part of a reoccurring theme in the class of visual statistics. These strategies have helped me significantly with getting better intuition for statistics, and I think these can help students too. Also shapes and colors are nice to have in lessons. It may sound more complex at first, but I see this lesson as a long term investment and I will work to provide good visual examples to make this less difficult.\

**Objectives:**

> Students can draw set symbols as venn diagrams
>
> Students understand how the set symbols relate to logical statements
>
> Students can understand when to apply conditional probability solutions, and use the formula
>
> Students know when it is appropriate to simply multiply and simply add probabilities for intersections and unions
>
> Students know how to calculate the at least once probability, and how this effects aspects of our daily lives

**Concepts:**

> Union, Intersection, Complement
>
> OR, AND, NOT
>
> Support
>
> IF, TRUE , FALSE
>
> Conditional probability
>
> Independent multiplication (AND)
>
> Disjoint/non disjoint addition (OR)
>
> At least once problem

**Intuition Tools:**

> a$\cap$ d, yoUr
>
> Set symbols as logic gates
>
> geometric distribution not fully named before using set symbols

**Lesson Material:**

Students will be given a wordless document with set symbols ,venn diagrams, the corresponding logic tables, and an example of the operation on a numerical set and a nominal set. This first document will have absolutely no words outside of AND, OR, NOT, and it will be a bit of an artsy delivery similar to NASAs golden record or SCP \...\|.....\|..\|. , but the purpose it not to be artsy, but to deliver the material in the simplest way possible and to encourage them to try and figure it out. Words can shut out brains down, so I think this will be an intreguining and engaging exercise.

Following some time in silence, a discussion will begin about the meaning.

SUPPPORT: all potential outcomes

UNION/OR: take all values present in both sets, no repeats

INTERSECTION/AND: take only the values that are present in both sets, no repeats

COMPLEMENT/NOT: Take only the values NOT in the set in question

EMPTY SET: set with nothing

After given these words, they will be asked to write them down on the paper, labeling the operations by name.

DISJOINT: The intersection is empty, both sets do not overlap

INDEPENDENCE: The outcome of one event doesn't effect the other

CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY: prob A given B=(A AND B)/B

Here we mention the operation for union of sets, and that if they are disjoint you can simply add them.

Finally we will explain that if events A and B are independent, you can multiply them together to get the probability of event A AND B as A\*B.

This will then be applied to a coin flip, where they will be asked to calculate the probability of rolling at least one heads out of 4 flips, which is the complement of the rolling all tails.

**ASSESSMENT:**

SET OPERATIONS: students will be given a variety of numeric and nominal sets, and asked to perform the set operations. These will start as individual ones, then combine multiple

Following these operations, the students will be asked to draw the Venn diagram with the support of the operation displayed

GEOMETRIC: students will be given an question where they calculate the probability of either a dice roll or lottery ticket succeeding at least once after a X tries. After, they will be asked to display the method they used in set symbols.

CONDITIONAL: students will be given a typical conditional probability question, and asked to evaluate the probability.

OPTIONAL: one idea I thought would be fun, but maybe not fun for anyone else, would be to give them sets of 1s and 0s and a flowchart with set symbols and as them to go down the line and find the output values. Then using a binary to decimal table, write the inputs and outputs, and finally they are asked what operation the paper calculator is performing (+-\*/)
