Variance: measure of variability present in a set of data.

This is calculated by taking average difference between each value and the mean of the data set

NOTE: xbar=mean

$Variance(population)= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\bar{x})}{n}$

$Variance(sample)= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\bar{x})}{n-1}$

Standard deviation: literally just the square root of the variance

$StandardDeviation=\sqrt{Variance}$

Distribution with lower variance

```{r}
x<- seq(-3,3, length=10000)
y=dnorm(x, sd=0.5)

plot(x,y, main="distribution with lower variance")
```

Distribution with higher variance

```{r}
x<- seq(-3,3, length=10000)
y=dnorm(x, sd=1.5)

plot(x,y,
     ylim=c(0,.8),
     main="distribution with higher variance")
```

OUTLIER: a data point that differs significantly from the rest of the data. What counts as an outlier is subjective and outliers aren't usually removed from data outside of specific circumstances.
