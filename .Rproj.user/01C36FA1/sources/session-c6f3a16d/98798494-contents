## DAY9

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sampling: 50 minutes

**Objectives:**

> Students will be able to identify different types of sampling
>
> Students will understand the potential issues with convenient sampling, as well as the necessity of convenient sampling
>
> Students will be able to explain what makes the results form a sample more generalizable.

**Concepts:**

> generalizability
>
> Representative sample
>
> generalizations
>
> bias
>
> convenient sampling
>
> simple random sampling
>
> sampling frame

**Intuition Tools:**

**Lesson Material:**

This is largely a vocab day so we will start with the vocab words

GENERALIZABILITY: how well the information in the sample works for the larger population rather than just being representative of the sample

REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE: a sample which is representative of the whole population for which it has been drawn.

GENERALIZATIONS: making conclusions from the sample, which can be used to make conclusions outside of the sample to the larger population

BIAS: when a statistic consistently overestimates or underestimates.

CONVINIENT SAMPLING: when samples are selected based on convenience and availability rather than more evenly dispersed randomness.

example: asking everyone outside of your workplace to take a poll rather than driving around your city to sample from all areas.

SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING: Every individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected an involved in the sample.

NOTE: it may seem like simple random sampling is "good" sampling and convenient sampling is "bad" sampling, but sometimes convenient sampling is selected for ethical reasons (e.g. only selecting **willing**Â participants) as using a true random sample would be unethical.

OTHER FORMS OF SAMPLING: These will not be mentioned in this session, but just know that they exist.

SAMPLING FRAME: list of all individuals in a population.

**Assessment:**

As with the former vocab activities, students will put in groups and assigned a board to write answers on in response to a prompt given on the projector. The prompt will describe an observational study, and the the students will have to answer the following questions:

-   What is the population?

-   What is the parameter of interest?

-   What is the sample?

-   What i the sampling frame?

-   What type of sampling is being used?

-   is there potential bias?

-   if so, why?

-   if so , how can this bias be improved?

Most of the questions will feature fairly obvious forms of bad convenience sampling, but one of the questions will be intentionally tricky. The sample will be for a medical trial which involves getting willing participants to be subjected to an invasive observation. Patients were found from areas all across the globe, with no geographical clustering. The thoroughness would lead you to think that it is not convenient sampling, but they still obtained willing participants, which has the potential for bias. While this is convenient sampling, it is hard to argue that it should be improved because the way to fix this would be to do the procedure involuntarily, which would be ethically wrong. (I am trying to focus on showing that convenient sampling is not always "bad" as I have heard some students describe it at such)
