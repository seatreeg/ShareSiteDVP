SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION: a distribution of a statistic obtained from a large number of samples pulled from a population. In other words, the distribution of the means. (in this context)

CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM: in many situations, for independent and identically distributed random samples, the distribution of the sample means approximates the normal distribution. In other words, the plot of the means often becomes normal.

STANDARDIZED STATISTIC=A value which represents how many standard deviations an input value is from the mean of the null distribution.

With this statistic, we have two options:

1\) we can use our standardized statistic on a Z table to calculate the P value

This is direct, just using a table

2\) we can find the critical value for our significance level and see if our standardized statistic is beyond that.

Our critical value depends on two things, the standard of significance we desire, and if we are interested in a "greater", "less than" ,or "not equal to" hypothesis.

CRITICAL VALUE: Point on distribution, in standard deviations, where standardized statistics beyond that value are considered significant.

This process shouldn't be applied to every situation, as there are some validity conditions:

-   Large enough sample size (subjective, but in our course 10 failures and 10 successes or 20 quantitative samples is enough)

-   Distribution must not be skewed or in general non-bell shaped

-   If the variable is not a proportion and is instead a mean, and population variance is not known, a t statistic has to be used instead of a z statistic (in next lesson)

Simulation ALWAYS works, however. #review this

$$
Z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$

Recipe for low p Values

-   As variation decreases, p value decreases

-   As the difference between the null mean and the alternative mean increase, the p value decreases .
