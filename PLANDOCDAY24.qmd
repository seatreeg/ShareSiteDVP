## DAY 24

**Objectives:**

Students can use the multiple means applet to do theory based comparison of two means.

Students can purely-visually compare means.

**Concepts:**

Confidence intervals (again)

Standard error \~ stdev \~ 95%ci/2

T test

F ratio (BRIEF)

Students know how to use error bars to reject or FTR the null (non difference)

**Intuition tools:**

Two lumps, visual comparison of groups (need large df 60+ and confidence level of .95)

Lumps with lines (stdev)

lumps with lines(confidence intervals=variance)

**Lesson Material:**

We will start with the validity conditions of theory based mm comparison.

This lesson will show some equations for the t test value and the confidence interval formula

$$
t=\frac{(x_1-x_2)-0}{SE}=\frac{x_1-x_2}{\sqrt{s^2_1/n_1+s^2_2/n_2}}
$$

$$
CI=\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_1} \pm multiplier*\sqrt{s^2_1/n_1+s^2_2/n_2}
$$

After some computation, students will then be (re?) introduced to the normal distribution visual SD method (going about .6 down the mode or using the inflection point) and the reintroduced to the 2SD method. Students will also be reminded that the SE is the (est) StDev of the sampling distribution, and that the confidence level can be assumed to be 2 if 95% confidence is desired.

```{r}
# edited code, not mine completely, just wanted to quickly demonstrate something visually
mean_value <- 0
sd_value <- 1

x <- seq(-4, 4, length=1000)

y <- dnorm(x, mean = mean_value, sd = sd_value)

plot(x, y, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2, xlab = "x", ylab = "Density",
     main = "Normal distribution 2SD CI")

abline(v = mean_value, col = "red", lwd = 2)

abline(h = max(y)*.6, col = "green", lwd = 2)

segments(x0 = -sd_value, x1 = mean_value, y0 = dnorm(-1, mean = mean_value, sd = sd_value),
         y1 = dnorm(-1, mean = mean_value, sd = sd_value), col = "purple", lwd = 2)
segments(x0 = -sd_value*2, x1 = mean_value, y0 = dnorm(2, mean = mean_value, sd = sd_value),
         y1 = dnorm(2, mean = mean_value, sd = sd_value), col = "purple", lwd = 2)

segments(x0 = -sd_value*2, x1 = sd_value*2, y0 = max(y),
         y1 = max(y), col = "grey", lwd = 2)


```

**Assessment:**

Students will start off with two groups of images each with two shaded lumps and be asked to find which one is more significantly different.

-Students will then be asked to write aproximate the stdeviation and confidence intervals using the visual method

-Studetns will then accept or reject using those CIs

-using combined stdev, they will be asked to calcuklate the sqrt(f) ratio (MAYBE NOT HAVE THIS)

(currently looking into the visual connection of the F ratio, so this is a work in progress. The within variance is easy to find visually, the between variance is the issue right now. Im basically looking for a way to calculate the between variance using only two normal distributions with means and variance known. I will look into this at a later time)

There willl also be some formula using questions just to make sure they can use the provided formula. These will be fairly standard and uninteresting but still usefull
