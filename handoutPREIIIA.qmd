library(DiagrammeR)


DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {

CLASS: groups of values

+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Count                   | Frequency                                                            |
|                         |                                                                      |
| (these are the classes) | (number of times a value within these classes showed up in the data) |
+=========================+======================================================================+
| 1-10                    | 2                                                                    |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 11-20                   | 5                                                                    |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 21-30                   | 3                                                                    |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

HISTOGRAM: A chart displaying the amount of elements in each class

```{r}


library(ggplot2)
df = data.frame(
  amt = c(1,2, 12,13,14,15,16,25,26,27)
)

cutoff <-c(0,11,21,31)
classttl <-c("1-10","11-20","21-30")
df$binz <- cut(df$amt, breaks=cutoff, labels=classttl, include.lowest = TRUE)


ggplot(df, aes(x=binz))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title="Histogram")+
  xlab("bins/classes")+
  ylab("Frequency")
```

RELATIVE FREQUENCY HISTOGRAM: like a normal histogram, but it shows the amount of said class relative to the total, rather than just the amount of said class. NOTE: the scale ranges from 0-100%, AKA, 0-1

```{r}


library(ggplot2)
df = data.frame(
  amt = c(1,2, 12,13,14,15,16,25,26,27)
)

cutoff <-c(0,11,21,31)
classttl <-c("1-10","11-20","21-30")
df$binz <- cut(df$amt, breaks=cutoff, labels=classttl, include.lowest = TRUE)


ggplot(df, aes(x=binz))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count))))+
  labs(title="Relative Frequency Histogram")+
  xlab("bins/classes")+
  ylab("Frequency/Total")
```

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION: Very similar to the relative frequency histogram, except the percentages on the y-axis can be thought of as probabilities. You can add these, so in the below example, if you were to put all of the numbers in a bag and select one at random, there is a 20% chance of getting a number between 1 and 10, and a 70% chance of getting a number between 1 and 20.

```{r}


library(ggplot2)
df = data.frame(
  amt = c(1,2, 12,13,14,15,16,25,26,27)
)

cutoff <-c(0,11,21,31)
classttl <-c("1-10","11-20","21-30")
df$binz <- cut(df$amt, breaks=cutoff, labels=classttl, include.lowest = TRUE)


ggplot(df, aes(x=binz))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count))))+
  labs(title="Probability distribution")+
  xlab("bins/classes")+
  ylab("Probability")
```

DISCRETE DISTRIBUTION: A probability distribution with a finite number of outcomes *between two different points.* In other words, you can only get certain exact numbers.

The distribution of a six sided die can be seen below:

```{r}



library(ggplot2)
df = data.frame(
  amt = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
)

cutoff <-c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)
classttl <-c("1","2","3","4", "5","6")
df$binz <- cut(df$amt, breaks=cutoff, labels=classttl, include.lowest = TRUE)


ggplot(df, aes(x=binz))+
  geom_bar(aes(y=after_stat(count) / sum(after_stat(count))))+
  labs(title="Distribution of 6 sided die")+
  xlab("Number Rolled")+
  ylab("Probability")
```

IMPORTANT CONCEPT: the probability of rolling a value is the area that that the bars take up, so for the chance of rolling a 1 or 2, the width of the bars is 1+1=2 and the height of the bars is $\approx$ 0.16666, so the probability of rolling one or two is 0.16666\*2 $\approx$ 0.3333 or 33.3%.

CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTION: A probability distribution with an infinite number of outcomes between two different points. (NOTE: there are an infinite number of real numbers between 0 and 1.)

```{r}


library(ggplot2)

listval <- data.frame(vals= seq(0,10,length.out=1000000))


ggplot(listval, aes(x=vals))+
  geom_density(fill="grey", color="black")+
  labs(title = "continuous probability distribution")+
  xlab("x")+
  ylab("density")
```

SHAPE: literally the shape of the distribution, visually.

NOTE: the distributions are below are a bit blocky, but continuous distributions can also have the same shapes.
